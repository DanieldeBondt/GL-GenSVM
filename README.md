# GL-GenSVM
A GenSVM extension implementing group lasso penalties

This is the codebase complementing my Bsc Thesis at the Erasmus School of Economics, ERASMUS UNIVERSITY ROTTERDAM 07/07/2019
Supervised by Prof. dr. Patrick J.F. Groenen

An extension on the GenSVM paper and package by Van den Burg and Groenen (2016)

The My_GenSVM class serves as the main algorithm object. It can be called either through the main.py script or by using Jupyter Notebooks, which are easily tweaked and used.
